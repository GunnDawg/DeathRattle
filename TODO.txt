* (PROJECT FILES)
 - (DONE) Fix the library directories and add a Dependencies folder to the solution directory.
 - Come up with a way to pack/compress and unpack/decompress asset files.

* (BUGS)
 - (Testing)Continue to optimize the delta clock. Taking the average does seem to be working though.
 - (Testing)Fix micro stutter. Find what's causing the main thread to pause. Could be related to the delta clock.

* (ENGINE)
 - Consider some type of asset manager. This will help with the messy code, but try to avoid an
   entity component system for now. A Data Oriented Design would have been useful here, but
   it's probably too late :(
 - Start using assertions at the public call sites of all objects/classes. This means asserting all
   paramatized constructors either for NULL checks, range checks, or type checks.
 - (IN PROGRESS)Implement spdlog and replace it with all the printf() calls.

* (CODE CLEAN UP)
 - Get rid of the excess UI RECTS (borders), and just call SDL_DrawRect on the original UI RECTS.
   The extra outline RECT is a waste.
 - Continue to look for ways to shorten code, it's a mess.

* (FEATURES)
 - When we have proper logging and a steril release build, start to look into
   the item system AGAIN (grrrr).
 - Implement a controller type in the options menu. The implementation for keyboard or mouse
   is already there, just needs to be implemented. Also look into gamepad implementation.
 - Get the Fullscreen / Windowed options working correctly. Currently only Windowed mode works.

* (GAMEPLAY)
 - Need to decide what we're gonna do with the level system. Is it even neccessary
   anymore? Do we want just one progressive level? And if so, how will that work?
 - Rework and come up with a better win / loss screen. Highly dependent on how we decide
   to handle the level / progression system.
