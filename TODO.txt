* (PROJECT FILES)
 - Fix the library directories and add a Dependencies folder to the solution directory.

* (BUGS)
 - Continue to test the delta clock. Taking the average does seem to be working though.
 - Fix micro stutter. Find what's causing the main thread to pause. Could be related to the delta clock.

 * (CODE CLEANUP)
  - Change all member initialization from value initialization to uniformm initialization

* (PERFORMANCE)
 - Implement spdlog and replace it with all the printf() calls.
 - Continue to look for ways to shorten code, it's a mess.

* (ORGANIZATION)
 - Consider some type of asset manager. This will help with the messy code, but try to avoid an
   entity component system for now. A Data Oriented Design would have been useful here, but
   it's probably too late :(
 - Start using assertions at the public call sites of all objects/classes. This means asserting all
   paramatized constructors either for NULL checks, range checks, or type checks.

* (FEATURES)
 - When we have proper logging and a steril release build, start to look into
   the item system AGAIN (grrrr).

* (GAMEPLAY)
 - Need to decide what we're gonna do with the level system. Is it even neccessary
   anymore? Do we want just one progressive level? And if so, how will that work?
