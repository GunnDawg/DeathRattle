-==(CORE)-==

	* (PERFORMANCE)
	 - (IN PROGRESS) HUD::Update() is causing higher than normal latency on the CPU due to Text::Update() reloading
	   the .ttf every frame. Let's store a pointer to the .ttf in the constructor and figure out a HAS_SCORE_CHANGED flag
	   system. This will reduce the amount of unnecessary calls to Text::Update(), and HUD::Update() significantly.

	* (ENGINE)
	 - Consider some type of asset manager. This will help with the messy code, but try to avoid an
	   entity component system for now. A Data Oriented Design would have been useful here, but
	   it's probably too late :(
	 - Start using assertions at the public call sites of all objects/classes. This means asserting all
	   paramatized constructors either for NULL checks, range checks, or type checks.
	 - Implement a controller type in the options menu. The implementation for keyboard or mouse
       is already there, just needs to be implemented. Also look into gamepad implementation.
     - Get the Fullscreen / Windowed options working correctly. Currently only Windowed mode works.

	* (CODE CLEAN UP)
	 - Get rid of the excess UI RECTS (borders), and just call SDL_DrawRect on the original UI RECTS.
	   The extra outline RECT is a waste.
	 - Continue to look for ways to shorten code, it's a mess.

	* (BUGS)
	 - Level Score isn't populating until after the game has started. This isn't really a big issue though
	   because we're going to start work on a new level/progression system anyways.

-==(GAMEPLAY)-==

	* (NEW LEVEL SYSTEM)
	 - Single stage, multiple levels.
	 - Level progression is based on score.
	 - Ball speed will ONLY increase with the level, and will no longer increase by hitting a marked paddle.
	   However, hitting a marked paddle will now deal more damage.
 
	* (NEW ITEM SYSTEM)
	 - Item drops will spawn every 5 seconds for the first level. After that, the time between item spawns
	   will be increased by 5 seconds per level.
	 - Items will be inventorized, rather than use on pickup. This will allow the player to choose when an item
	   can be used.
	 - Debuff items will be used on pickup as they are NOT a good thing to get, you want to avoid those.
